Your personal dota assistant that provides helpful information about Dota2 that can help you improve your game.
<hr>
DOTA is a massively complex game with 113 heroes, 160 items, and countless details, mechanics, and interactions to memorize. The sheer amount of information is nearly insurmountable. New players to the game are generally referred to the canonical new player guide "Welcome to DOTA, you suck".

<br>
However, the game is currently one of the biggest esports games in the world, along with League of Legends, Starcraft, Counter-Strike, etc. Every year, Valve hosts "The International", a DOTA 2 tournament here in Seattle. The event fills Key Arena to capacity with fans and spectators who have come to see their favorite teams compete to be the world champion, and to take home a significant portion of the yearly prize pool.
<br>
This prize pool has grown from just under three million dollars in 2013 to over twenty-two million dollars (and counting) in 2017. The prize pool is funded by people who play the game and buy in-game items.
<br>
This represents an enormous opportunity for user engagement.
<br>
We have created a bot (using Microsoft Bot Framework and Microsoft Cognitive Services) to allow users to learn more about the game, and to keep track of their favorite teams. The bot can be used from any of the channels that the Microsoft Bot Framework supports, including Skype, Slack, Teams, etc.
